I believe I have completed the user path, and the should and coulds. However, the below are the enhancements I would implement with additional time:

1. I would have enhanced the CSS further and likely incorporated media queries to improve mobile responsiveness. Specifically, I would make adjustments to some widths and images (such as the logo) to better cater to mobile responsiveness.

2. Although Redux could have been an option for state management, I found Context-API and prop-drilling to be more suitable. I used Context-API for favouriting a song, as it seemed like a feature that could be scaled with future developments, i.e. accessed from different parts of the app.

3. For colour management, I used some variables from your website, which are visible under App.css. I would have liked to only use variables and avoid individual entry.

4. I overlooked some hover effects, like the 'more like this' feature that appears when hovering over a track item, displaying a play icon over the image. Instead, I opted for the mobile view. However, I hope I have shown that I am capable of carrying UI tasks like this with other styling throughout the app.

5. In terms of testing, I managed to write tests for only two components. Due to time constraints, I was unable to conduct a comprehensive suite of tests, especially end-to-end tests, which I particularly enjoy.

6. I envisioned separating SFX and Tracks into different tabs, similar to your website's layout. This would involve calling both SFX and Tracks within the API call "collection: type" and utilizing React Router for tab navigation.

7. Currently, favoriting tracks relies solely on state, leading to data loss upon refreshing as it's stored in browser memory. Implementing local storage or an online user storage with an API call to emulate local storage would be a more robust solution.

8. I could have tried out react-query for caching API calls
